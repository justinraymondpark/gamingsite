# Image Reordering & Error Fixes

## âœ¨ New Feature: Drag & Drop to Reorder Screenshots

You can now rearrange your screenshots by dragging them!

### How to Use:
1. Go to **Admin â†’ Manage Content**
2. Click **Edit** on any note or review with images
3. In the image grid, **grab any screenshot and drag it** to a new position
4. Drop it where you want it
5. The order will be saved when you click **Save Changes**

### Visual Feedback:
- Each image shows its **position number** (1, 2, 3...)
- When dragging, the image becomes **semi-transparent**
- Drop zones highlight when you hover over them
- Cursor changes to a **move cursor** when hovering over images

### Why This Matters:
- Put your best screenshot first
- Organize images in story order
- Reorder without re-uploading

## ðŸ”§ Fixed: Better Error Messages

### Before:
```
Failed to update review
```

### Now:
```
Failed to update review: column "content" violates not-null constraint
```

You'll now see the **exact error message** from Supabase, making it much easier to debug issues!

### How to Use:
1. If an update fails, check the browser console (F12)
2. You'll see a detailed error message
3. The alert will also show the specific error

## Common Update Errors & Solutions

### "column violates not-null constraint"
**Problem**: You're trying to save empty required fields  
**Solution**: Make sure review title and content aren't empty

### "value too long for type character varying"
**Problem**: Text is too long for the field  
**Solution**: Shorten your content (notes are limited to 280 chars)

### "new row violates row-level security policy"
**Problem**: Database permissions issue  
**Solution**: Check your Supabase RLS policies
